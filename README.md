This is a Phaser 3 project template that uses Vite for bundling. It supports hot-reloading for quick development workflow, w/ TypeScript support and scripts to generate production-ready builds. Forked from [https://github.com/phaserjs/template-webpack-ts] made by FrontEndParty for grab and go game jams.

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install project dependencies |
| `npm run dev` | Launch a development web server |
| `npm run build` | Create a production build in the `dist` folder |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint to check code (very relaxed rules for game jam) |

## Writing Code

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development server by running `npm run dev`.

The local development server runs on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

Once the server is running you can edit any of the files in the `src` folder. Vite will automatically recompile your code and then reload the browser.

## Linting and Code Style

This project uses **very relaxed** linting rules optimized for rapid game jam development:

- **TypeScript** is configured with minimal strictness - only catching errors that would prevent compilation
- **ESLint** is configured with all style rules turned off - focus on shipping, not on perfect code
- **VSCode settings** are shared in the `.vscode` folder to provide a consistent experience

If you're using VSCode, we recommend installing the [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint). The shared settings will automatically configure it for you.

The philosophy: if it compiles and runs, it's good enough for a game jam! ðŸš€
